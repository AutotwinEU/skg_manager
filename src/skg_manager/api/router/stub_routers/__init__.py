"""What is a stub router?

On wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub) a Method stud is described as  a short and simple
placeholder for a method that is not yet written for production needs.
Generally, a method stub contains just enough code to allow it to be used â€“ a declaration with any parameters,
and if applicable, a return value.[2]

A method stub may be used to implement an interface that is defined but for which the implementation is not available.
